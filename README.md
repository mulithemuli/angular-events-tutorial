# Event handling with Angular

This project tries to explain Publish-Subscribe Patterns by providing some tasks which the user should solve.

These tasks explain themselves on the page. Just clone the repository, run ``npm install`` and start the
dev server to begin solving them.

For the solution look into the directory ``solutions`` which contains the entire content of ``src/app``.
Just copy them over to the actual ``app`` directory and recompile the app. Or sneak peek into single files
if stuck.
